<h2>End of year project</h2>
Atomic Lemon is my end of year project for my second and last year at the CNAM-ENJMIN school. We are a class of 56 students splitted in 6 fields : Sound design, visual design, UX design, management, game design and development.

During this year we've to create the vertical slice of a game in a team of 11 students, and the project that I've choosed to work on is : Atomic Lemon.

<h2>The game and my role in it</h2>
Atomic Lemon is a 3D sidescrolling beat'em'up where you play as Lemon a little girl from the favelas of Rio that want to defend her cultural street heritage from bad guys. She's helped by her friend, the graffiti of a sloth.

During this devblog I'll show our progression in the development of this game.

We've started this project one month ago and for the moment we're still in a stage of design, our game designers are thinking about the core mechanics of the game and the visual and sound designers are making concepts and the first assets of the game.

For my part I've been working on the implementation of the core mechanics in the game, and I've also take some time to learn how to use Unreal because the last time I've tried it it was in the UDK 3 version.

It was hard to totaly change my environment and lose the effiency that I've gained on Unity during the last year and a half, but it's worth the effort and I'm now used to the blueprint logic and possibilities and it's a pleasure to try a new mechanic.

<h2>What I've done so far</h2>

- Movement
- Dash
