The goal of this exercise was to create at least 4 different landscapes and tell a story through them. The main constraint was to not having a living person, because this would have created questions like : who are them ? why are they here ?

Our main idea was to tell the story of an old civilization, with the following landscapes : a desert of skin and hair, a mountain of flesh and muscles, a river of dead bodies, a mountain of household appliances, a forest of pylon and cameras.

We were a team of 6 students :

* Tara Quinsac (Artist)
* Noémie Szmrzsik-Cohard (Artist)
* Charlotte Couder (Game designer)
* Anize Amestoy (Sound designer)
* Yannis Attard (Developer)
* Clément Rondeau (Developer)
