The theme we choosed for the jam was : "Medical", we quickly thought about using the controllers on the player's feet and from this we get the final idea. This was my first VR and 3D game, it was a great exercise to learn both at the same time while getting the chance to develop on a HTC Vive device.

It was my first experience in VR development and the VRTK library helped us a lot to quickly setup a space where the player can move and interact with the puzzles. The time span was very short, so we had to be efficient in our development.
