Deadly Riff is a **rhythm versus fighting game** made for the AirConsole Contest 2017.

<br>

We were a team of 4 students :
* Charlotte Couder (Game design)
* Alexandre Cornudet (Artist)
* Antoine Wert (Sound design)
* Cl√©ment Rondeau (Developer)
<br>

<h2>Tasks</h2>
As the only developer in the team, I've been in charge of all the gameplay programming part. The toughest tasks on this project were:
* Integration of AirConsole into the project
* Creation of an easy setup to playtest in real conditions
* The sequencer that will launch the notes stored in a file, precisely and in synchronization with the music
