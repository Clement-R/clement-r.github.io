  As the only developer in the team, I've been in charge of all the gameplay programming part. The toughest tasks on this project were:
tasks:
  - Integration of AirConsole into the project
  - Creation of an easy setup to playtest in real conditions
  - The sequencer that will launch the notes stored in a file, precisely and in synchronization with the music
