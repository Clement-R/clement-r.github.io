The main difficulty that I've encountered in this game was the capture system. To keep in memory the position that the player has been through, I've partitioned the world in a grid and I've saved the cells on which the player has driven.

In a big compound array I've stored the building GameObject and the cells around it, if a player's positions array contains all the cells around one building then he captures it.

Also, if a cell is going to be added to the player's positions array then we know that he looped and we can remove its path and check if he captures a building.
