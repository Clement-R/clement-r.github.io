Unfold is a cooperation and shooter game for two with one blindfolded person.  
The first character, which is a little fox has to guide the second one, an energic grandma, with sounds in order to spot possessed origamis and unfold them.

My work on the game was to find a way to create a good sound spatialization, and also ease the integration of the work from our sound designer into the Unity project.  
The choice has been made to use Wwise, it was the good time for us to learn how to use it.

Another big part of my work earlier in the project was to create prototypes to test new gameplay ideas.  
It includes the wave system and the basis of a shoot'em'up.
