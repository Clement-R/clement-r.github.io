Our idea was that you're playing a god and your tribe want to attack the other tribe, you must keep your soldiers on your side by picking them up and place them in your base.

My goal on this jam was to get a simple game fast (by the end of the first day) and polish it on the second day of the jam to get something that seems really finished.

By the end of the first day the main mechanics was working, only the special behaviors (a dash and a sprint effect for two special pieces) was to code. But the integration of the Wwise project took some time, I first had to learn how to use the switch system that enable to create an interactive music. And there were also sound effects that took more time to get in the game.

At the middle of the afternoon I implemented all the menus (main menu, lobby, credits, in-game pause and victory), and got the animations integrated one hour before the deadline. A Unity Collab pull got some of my modifications vanished, but the game is in the end fun to play even if the colliders need some rework and we could have discover that sooner with a playtest session with an other team.

This game jam was still one of my best because our workflow was very smooth and it was a joy to work on this game.
