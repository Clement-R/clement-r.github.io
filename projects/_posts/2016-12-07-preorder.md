excerpt: |
  Art installation where you discover an archive from an old civilization.
abstract: |
  The goal of this exercise was to create at least 4 different landscapes and tell a story through them. The main constraint was to not having a living person, because this would have created questions like : who are them ? why are they here ?

Our main idea was to tell the story of an old civilization, with the following landscapes : a desert of skin and hair, a mountain of flesh and muscles, a river of dead bodies, a mountain of household appliances, a forest of pylon and cameras.

The visitor must scratch the tablet to discover a fresco on which they can move with touch controls. The device was hidden in a box that the visitor must open to begin the experience.
