Rhythm versus fighting game made for the AirConsole Contest 2017. Unfortunately we didn't make it to the top 10, but it was still a great project for a one month game.

We were a team of 4 students :

* Charlotte Couder  (Game design)
* Alexandre Cornudet (Artist)
* Antoine Wert (Sound design)
* Cl√©ment Rondeau (Developer)
